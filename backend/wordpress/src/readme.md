# Required Theme Files
* `style.css`
  - Your theme’s main stylesheet file. This file will also include information about your theme, such as author name, version number, and plugin URL, in it’s header.

* `index.php`
  - The main template file for your theme. This will be the template for the homepage on your site unless a static front page is specified. If you only include this template file, it must include all functionality of your theme. However, you can use as many relevant template files as you want in your theme.

* `comments.php`
  - The comment template which is included wherever comments are allowed. This file should provide support for threaded comments and trackbacks, and should style author comments differently then user comments. See the Comments page for more information.

* `screenshot.png`
  - In the WordPress.org theme directory, `screenshot.png` acts as a visual indicator of what your theme looks like. It is visible both in the web view and in the admin dashboard. Note: this screenshot can be no larger than *1200x900px.*

## Optional directories
- `./themes`
- `./vendors`
